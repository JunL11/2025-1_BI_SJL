The mouse let7 miRNA family consists of multiple members, such as let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and mir-98
Even though these members are known to have conserved GGAG motif for LIN28A binding with exception of let-7c-2, 
it seems that not all members are effected by LIN28 according to CLIP-seq data (Fig.1E).

My goal of YOA assignment is to analyze whether site mutation occur in unshown let7 family members.
CLIP sequence alignment of these members will be shown as Fig.S2, with further analysis if possible.
